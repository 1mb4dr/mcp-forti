    """
    Retrieves traffic logs from FortiGate.
    Note: FortiGate log APIs can be complex. This is a simplified version.
          For production, you'll need to consult the FortiGate REST API documentation
          for your specific FortiOS version for accurate log fetching, filtering, and pagination.
          The `fortigate-api` library might offer helper functions or require direct `get`/`post` calls.

    Args:
        fgt_client: An initialized FortiGateAPI client instance.
        log_filter (str, optional): Filter to apply to the logs (e.g., "srcip=1.2.3.4").
                                   The exact filter syntax depends on the FortiGate API.
        max_logs (int, optional): Maximum number of log entries to retrieve.
        time_range (str, optional): Time range for logs, e.g., "1hour", "24hours", "7days".
                                    This is a conceptual parameter; actual API might use start/end timestamps.

    Returns:
        list or dict: A list of log entries, or an error message.
